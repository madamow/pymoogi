c******************************************************************************
c     This is the main driver for MOOG.  It reads the parameter
c     file and sends MOOG to various controlling subroutines.
c     This is the normal interactive version of the code; for batch
c     processing without user decisions, run MOOGSILENT instead.

c*****in compiling MOOG, here the various machine-specific things are 
c     declared.  First, define the directory where MOOG lives, in order to 
c     be able to pull in auxiliary data files; executing 'make' will 
c     generate a reminder of this necessity
      call getenv("MOOGPATH", moogpath)


c*****declare this to be the normal interactive version; variable "silent"
c     will be queried on all occasions that might call for user input;
c     DON'T CHANGE THIS VARIABLE; 
c     if silent = 'n', the normal interactive MOOG is run;
c     if silent = 'y', the non-interactive MOOG is run
      silent = 'y'
      
c*****invoke the overall starting routine
1     control = '       '
      call begin


c*****use one of the standard driver routines ("isotop" is obsolete):
      if     (control .eq. 'synth  ') then
         call synth  
      elseif (control .eq. 'abfind ') then
         call abfind
      elseif (control .eq. 'ewfind ') then
         call ewfind
      elseif (control .eq. 'blends ') then
         call blends

c*****or, put in your own drivers in the form below....
      elseif (control .eq. 'mine  ') then
         call  mydriver 


c*****or else you are out of luck!
      else
         array = 'THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE DRIVERS.  TRY AGAIN (y/n)?'

         istat = ivmove (3,1)
         read (*,*) yesno
